This is the readme file of the Python Robot Model Tools.

The modules in the `robmodel` package allow to model some aspects of articulated
robots, such as connectivity, numbering scheme of the links, attached frames,
geometry, etc.

The `rmt` package implements a command line program that operates on robot
models, such as the URDF or the KinDSL formats. See

```
rmt --help
```

for a list of the available sub commands.

You can also try the program without installing the packages in this repository
(although you still need to install the dependencies):
```
cd src/
./runner.py --help
```

# Code documentation

More information about the packages and the modules of this project is available
in the source code.

You can generate e.g. html documentation using
[pdoc3](https://pdoc3.github.io/pdoc/) (requires Python 3.5+).
For example:

```sh
pip install pdoc3  # don't forget the '3'
cd src/
pdoc --html --config show_source_code=False -o /tmp/docs/rmt rmt/ robmodel/
```

# Installation
Please install from source code, using `pip`:

```sh
git clone <repo> rmt    # replace <repo> with the right URL
cd rmt/
pip install .           # should also install the dependencies available in PyPI
```

The [`kgprim`](https://github.com/mfrigerio17/kgprim) package must be installed
manually in order to use the Robot Model Tools (it is not yet in the PyPI).

Do **not** install with `python setup.py install`. However, you can clean the
source tree after installation with `python setup.py realclean`.

#### Virtual environment
You might want to install the tool and its dependencies in an isolated virtual
environment. If so, run the following before the installation procedure:

```sh
mkdir myvenv && python3 -m venv myvenv
source myvenv/bin/activate  # may need to pick another script depending on your shell
pip install wheel           # also required to set up the env
```

## Dependencies
Python >= 3.3

The following libraries are used by this project:

- [kgprim](https://github.com/mfrigerio17/kgprim) kinematics/geometric primitives

- [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/), for the connectivity model, which is a
  graph

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org)

- [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org)

Optionally:

- [textX](http://textx.github.io/textX/stable/), for the KinDSL format importer

- [PyYAML](http://pyyaml.org), to import YAML models

- [Mako](https://www.makotemplates.org/), for the export of models to other
  formats (which involves text generation)

- [PyGraphviz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/), required only by the DOT file
  generator command of the `rmt` tool

```
pip install wheel networkx numpy sympy textx pyyaml pygraphviz
```
