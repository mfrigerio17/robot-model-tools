'''
The Robot Model Tool (rmt) package.

A command line tool for the inspection and conversion of
articulated robot models in different formats, like KinDSL and URDF.

Normally, the modules of this package and their API are not relevant for the
end user, since they are limited to the command line tool. For programmatic
usage of the API to load robot models, refer to the `robmodel` package, which
this package largely relies on.
